OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project Title:"Demographic Insights: Analyzing Salary Distribution by Age and Gender"
Project Description
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and feature engineering task performed using Python with the Pandas library. The goal was to manipulate and analyze a dataset containing personal information about individuals, including their names, ages, genders, salaries, and cities. The project includes loading data, cleaning, transforming, and creating new features to derive insights.

2. Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of the following columns:

Name: The name of the individual.
Age: The age of the individual.
Gender: The gender of the individual.
Salary: The annual salary of the individual.
City: The city where the individual resides.
3. Objectives
Load the dataset from a CSV file and display its structure.
Perform data cleaning to handle any missing or incorrect values.
Create new features from existing data to enhance analytical capabilities.
Analyze the relationship between salary and age by creating a new feature called Salary_per_Age.
Prepare the dataset for further analysis, such as feature selection and target variable identification.
4. Key Features
Data Loading: Utilized Pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame for analysis.
Data Cleaning: Ensured numeric columns were correctly interpreted and handled any missing values.
Feature Engineering: Created a new feature, Salary_per_Age, to provide insights into the income distribution relative to age.
Data Exploration: Displayed available columns and a preview of the dataset to understand its structure.
5. Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy
Environment: Google Colab for interactive coding and data analysis.
